### Post 1: Comment Response - "How many fish in my 20 gallon?"

**Target Thread Type:** New hobbyist asking about stocking levels

**Content:**
The old "inch per gallon" rule is pretty outdated. A 20-gallon tank can hold very different stocking depending on the fish.

**Better framework:**

**Bioload matters more than length:**
- 10 neon tetras (1 inch each) = light bioload, totally fine
- 1 goldfish (6 inches) = heavy bioload, will outgrow the tank

**Territory matters:**
- 20 gallons is great for schooling fish (tetras, rasboras, corydoras)
- Not great for territorial fish (cichlids, bettas with aggressive tank mates)

**For a 20-gallon long, I'd stock something like:**
- 10-12 neon tetras or similar small schooling fish
- 6-8 corydoras (bottom feeders)
- 1 centerpiece fish (like a dwarf gourami or honey gourami)
- Some shrimp and snails

**Or a different approach:**
- 1 betta + 8 corydoras + shrimp/snails
- 15 rasboras + 6 kuhli loaches

**Red flags for overstocking:**
- Ammonia/nitrite readings (should always be 0)
- Nitrates climbing fast (above 40ppm weekly)
- Fish gasping at surface
- Aggressive behavior (often from overcrowding stress)

What kind of fish were you thinking about? That'll help dial in a specific plan.

**Notes:**
- Debunks outdated rule (builds authority)
- Multiple stocking examples (helpful)
- No link needed

### Post 2: Comment Response - "What size heater for 30 gallon?"

**Target Thread Type:** Equipment sizing question

**Content:**
Standard rule is 3-5 watts per gallon, so for 30 gallons you're looking at 90-150W.

**I'd go with 100-150W for a few reasons:**

1. **Headroom** - If your room gets cold in winter, a bigger heater won't struggle
2. **Efficiency** - A 150W heater running at 60% is quieter and lasts longer than a 100W running at 90%
3. **Faster recovery** - After water changes, gets back to temp quicker

**The case for TWO smaller heaters:**
Some people run 2x 75W heaters instead of 1x 150W:
- Better heat distribution in the tank
- Redundancy if one fails
- If one fails "on," it's less likely to cook your fish

I run a single 150W Eheim in my 30-gallon and it's been rock solid for 3 years. Keeps temp within 1 degree.

**Avoid:**
- Cheap no-name heaters (they fail stuck ON and boil your fish - not worth saving $10)
- Oversizing too much (300W+ in a 30-gallon is asking for trouble if it fails on)

**Brands I trust:**
- Eheim Jager (what I use)
- Aqueon Pro
- Fluval E-series (digital display is nice)

What temperature are you targeting? Tropical (78F) or cooler water?

**Notes:**
- Specific wattage formula
- Pros/cons of different approaches
- Brand recommendations with reasoning
- Expected engagement: 10-20 upvotes

### Post 3: Discussion Post - "Post your actual stocking vs what AqAdvisor says"

**Target Subreddit:** r/Aquariums

**Title:** How accurate is AqAdvisor really? Post your actual stocking vs the calculator

**Content:**
I've been using AqAdvisor for years and it's been pretty good, but I'm curious how it matches up with real-world experience.

**My 29-gallon:**

**AqAdvisor says:**
- 92% stocked
- Filtration capacity adequate
- Weekly 30% water changes recommended

**Actual stocking:**
- 12 neon tetras
- 8 pygmy corydoras
- 1 honey gourami
- 6 amano shrimp
- Too many snails to count

**Reality:**
- Nitrates stay under 20ppm with weekly 25% changes
- Fish are healthy, breeding behavior
- No aggression issues

**My take:** AqAdvisor slightly underestimates what a well-filtered, planted tank can handle.

**What's your experience?**

Post:
- Tank size
- What AqAdvisor percentage said
- Your actual stocking
- How it's actually going

Curious if there are patterns - like maybe AqAdvisor is more conservative for beginners, or spot-on for specific setups?

**Notes:**
- Data gathering from community
- Invites comparison and discussion
- No links needed
- Expected engagement: 40-70 comments with stockings lists

### Post 4: Comment Response - "Ammonia spike after adding fish"

**Target Thread Type:** Someone experiencing new tank syndrome

**Content:**
You're experiencing a mini-cycle. Adding more fish increases bioload faster than your beneficial bacteria can catch up.

**Why this happens:**
Beneficial bacteria populations grow to match the ammonia being produced. New fish = more ammonia = bacteria need time to multiply.

**What to do RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Stop feeding** - Uneaten food creates more ammonia. Your fish can go 3-5 days without food safely.

2. **Daily water changes** - 25-50% to keep ammonia under 0.25ppm until cycle catches up. Use dechlorinator.

3. **Test daily** - Ammonia and nitrite should be zero in a cycled tank. Keep changing water until they are.

4. **Don't add more fish** - Let the tank stabilize first.

**Optional boosters:**
- Seachem Stability or similar bacteria supplement
- Turn up filtration/aeration (bacteria need oxygen)

**Timeline:**
Usually takes 5-10 days for bacteria to catch up. You'll know you're good when:
- Ammonia stays at 0 for 3 days straight
- Nitrites stay at 0 for 3 days straight
- Nitrates are rising (proof bacteria is working)

**Prevention next time:**
Add fish SLOWLY. Like 3-4 fish per week max, not 10 fish at once. Gives bacteria time to scale up with the bioload.

What's your current ammonia reading? If it's above 0.5ppm, do a 50% water change right now.

**Notes:**
- Emergency guidance (time-sensitive)
- Clear action steps
- Prevention advice for future
- Expected engagement: 15-25 upvotes

### Post 5: Comment Response - "How much substrate for 40 gallon?"

**Target Thread Type:** Tank setup question

**Content:**
Depends on what you're going for, but here's the math:

**For a 40-gallon breeder (36" x 18" base):**

**Light substrate bed (1-1.5 inches):**
- About 40-60 lbs of gravel
- Good for: Non-planted tanks, easy vacuuming

**Medium substrate bed (2-3 inches):**
- About 80-100 lbs of gravel
- Good for: Light planting, natural look

**Deep substrate bed (3-4 inches):**
- About 120-150 lbs total
- Good for: Heavily planted, root-feeding plants
- Usually layered (dirt/soil base + sand/gravel cap)

**What I do:**
I slope mine - 1-2 inches in front, 3-4 inches in back. Creates depth perception and helps debris collect in front for easier cleaning. Used about 80 lbs for this approach.

**Substrate types matter for quantity:**
- Sand: Heavier, need more weight for same depth (1.5x gravel amounts)
- Soil: Lighter, need less weight
- Lava rock/clay: Much lighter

**Pro tip:** Buy 25% more than you think you need. Way easier to return unopened bags than make a second trip.

What substrate type are you using? That'll help dial in the exact amount.

**Notes:**
- Practical math with multiple options
- Sloping tip adds value
- Material type consideration
- Expected engagement: 8-15 upvotes

### Post 6: Comment Response - "CO2 or high light first?"

**Target Thread Type:** Someone planning planted tank upgrade

**Content:**
High light without CO2 is asking for algae hell. CO2 without high light is fine but you won't see dramatic growth.

**The relationship:**
Light drives photosynthesis. CO2 is the raw material. Nutrients are the building blocks.

**If you crank light but don't have enough CO2:**
- Plants can't photosynthesize fast enough
- Excess light energy = algae opportunity
- You'll be fighting hair algae, staghorn, BBA forever

**Better upgrade paths:**

**Path 1 (What I recommend):**
1. Medium light
2. Add CO2
3. Dial in fertilization
4. THEN increase light if you want faster growth

**Path 2 (Budget-conscious):**
1. Keep low-medium light
2. Stick with easy plants (anubias, java fern, crypts)
3. Skip CO2 entirely
4. Enjoy slow, stable growth

**Path 3 (All-in):**
1. Add CO2 and high light simultaneously
2. Be ready for intensive maintenance
3. Expect algae battles while you dial it in
4. Worth it if you want a competition-level tank

**My experience:**
Went high light before CO2. Spent 6 months battling algae. Added CO2, algae disappeared within 3 weeks. Wish I'd done CO2 first.

**Real talk on CO2:**
- Entry cost: $150-300 for pressurized setup
- Refills: $20-30 every 6-12 months
- Worth it if you're serious about planted tanks
- Not worth it if you just want some plants

What's your current light situation? That'll help decide the best next step.

**Notes:**
- Addresses common mistake (high light first)
- Multiple paths for different goals/budgets
- Personal mistake story (relatable)
- Expected engagement: 20-35 upvotes

### Post 7: Success Story - "Low-tech planted tank 1 year update"

**Target Subreddit:** r/PlantedTank

**Title:** 1 year with a low-tech planted tank - proof you don't need CO2

**Content:**
Posting this because I see a lot of people thinking you need CO2, high-tech lights, and $500 of equipment for a nice planted tank.

You don't.

**My setup:**
- 20-gallon long
- Nicrew LED light (the $30 one from Amazon)
- Aquaclear 50 filter
- Pool filter sand substrate
- Root tabs every 3 months
- Seachem Flourish 2x per week

**No CO2. No fancy substrate. No high-end lights.**

**Plants thriving:**
- Java fern (huge, constantly sprouting babies)
- Anubias nana (slow but steady)
- Cryptocoryne (multiple varieties, all growing)
- Amazon swords (need root tabs but doing well)
- Water sprite (grows like a weed, have to trim monthly)

**What I learned:**

1. **Light patience** - Growth is slow (1-2 new leaves per month) but steady
2. **Less is more** - Low light = less algae, less maintenance
3. **Choose the right plants** - Low-light, slow-growing species are bulletproof
4. **Stability beats intensity** - Consistent schedule matters more than powerful equipment

**Maintenance:**
- 30% water change weekly
- Trim water sprite monthly
- Add root tabs quarterly
- Total time: 20 minutes per week

**Cost breakdown:**
- Light: $30
- Root tabs: $15 (lasts a year)
- Liquid ferts: $12 (lasts 6 months)
- Plants (initial): $40

**Total: ~$100 for a year of planted tank success.**

Posting this for anyone who thinks planted tanks are expensive or complicated. They CAN be, but they don't HAVE to be.

**Photos:** [would include photos if posting for real]

**Notes:**
- Encourages beginners (low barrier to entry)
- Specific costs and maintenance time
- Realistic expectations (slow growth)
- Expected engagement: 40-80 upvotes, saved by many beginners

### Post 8: Comment Response - "What size tank for a betta?"

**Target Thread Type:** New betta owner asking minimum tank size

**Content:**
Absolute minimum: 5 gallons. Ideal: 10+ gallons.

I know pet stores sell those 1-gallon bowls. They're terrible. Here's why:

**Why small tanks are hard:**

1. **Water quality crashes fast** - In 1 gallon, one extra flake of food spikes ammonia. In 10 gallons, the water dilutes it.

2. **Temperature swings** - Small water volume = temperature changes fast. Bettas need stable 78-80F.

3. **Boredom** - Bettas are intelligent. A bowl is like living in a closet your whole life.

**What your betta actually needs:**

**Minimum (5 gallon):**
- Heated (78-80F)
- Filtered (low flow - they don't like current)
- Cycled (beneficial bacteria established)

**Better (10 gallon):**
- All the above
- Room to swim and explore
- Can add tank mates (shrimp, snails, maybe peaceful fish)
- More stable water parameters

**My setup (10 gallon):**
- 1 betta
- 6 kuhli loaches (they ignore each other)
- Nerite snail
- Amano shrimp

Betta is WAY more active in 10 gallons vs the 5 I started with. He patrols, investigates plants, builds bubble nests. Actually behaves like a fish, not a decoration.

**Budget reality:**
- 5-gallon kit: $40-60 (tank, filter, light)
- Heater: $15-20
- Decor/plants: $20-30
- Total: ~$80

I know that's more than a bowl, but your betta will live 3-5 years instead of 6 months, and you'll actually enjoy keeping it.

What size tank are you considering?

**Notes:**
- Strong stance on proper care (builds authority)
- Explains WHY, not just rules
- Budget breakdown for hesitant buyers
- Expected engagement: 20-40 upvotes

### Post 9: Comment Response - "What size sump for 75 gallon display?"

**Target Thread Type:** Saltwater equipment sizing

**Content:**
General rule: Sump should be 20-30% of display volume, so for 75 gallons you're looking at 15-25 gallon sump.

**But size isn't the only factor:**

**What matters more:**

1. **Chamber layout** - Need space for:
   - Mechanical filtration (filter sock/floss)
   - Protein skimmer
   - Return pump chamber
   - Optional: refugium, ATO reservoir, media reactors

2. **Height** - Taller is better than wider. You want 16"+ depth for a good skimmer.

3. **Overflow capacity** - Your sump needs to handle the water volume that drains down when power goes out. This is the #1 cause of floods.

**Sizing for safety:**

When your return pump shuts off, water siphons from your display down to the sump until it hits the overflow level.

**Calculate your drain volume:**
- Measure from water surface to bottom of overflow
- Calculate that volume in your display tank
- Your sump needs that much empty space at operating level

**Example:**
- 75-gallon tank with 4 inches from surface to overflow
- 4 inches in a 75g = roughly 10 gallons
- Your sump needs 10 gallons of empty space above normal water level

**What I run:**
- 75-gallon display
- 20-gallon long sump (30" x 12" x 12")
- Filled to 12 gallons when running
- 8 gallons of emergency overflow capacity

Works perfectly, never had a flood issue.

**Pro tip:** Test your overflow capacity BEFORE adding saltwater. Fill with fresh water, mark operating level, kill power, see where it settles.

What overflow system are you running? That affects drain volume calculation.

**Notes:**
- Advanced audience (reef keeping)
- Safety-focused (flooding prevention)
- Math explained clearly
- Expected engagement: 10-18 upvotes

## r/Goldfish Posts

### Post 10: Comment Response - "Goldfish in a bowl - upgrade help"

**Target Thread Type:** Someone realizing their goldfish needs a bigger tank

**Content:**
Good on you for recognizing they need an upgrade. Seriously - that's the hardest step.

**Goldfish reality:**
- Common/comet goldfish: Need 40+ gallons EACH as adults
- Fancy goldfish: Need 20-30 gallons for first fish, +10-20 per additional

They're pond fish sold as bowl fish. It's a pet store scam that's been going on forever.

**Upgrade path:**

**Immediate (if budget is tight):**
- 20-gallon tub from hardware store ($15)
- Sponge filter ($10) + air pump ($15)
- Water conditioner ($8)
- **Total: ~$50**

Not beautiful, but gets them healthy while you plan the real setup.

**Better (invest in proper tank):**
- 40-gallon breeder tank (used on Craigslist: $40-60)
- Canister filter or oversized HOB (goldfish are messy - need 10x GPH)
- No heater needed (goldfish like it cool)
- **Total: $150-200**

**What to expect:**
Your goldfish will GROW. Like, double in size within 6 months if they've been stunted in a bowl. This is good - means they're healthy - but it also means they'll outgrow even a 40-gallon eventually.

**Long-term plan:**
- Stock pond (ideal)
- 75+ gallon tank
- Rehome to someone with a pond (check local aquarium clubs)

**Right now:**
If they're in a bowl, do 50% water changes DAILY until you get the bigger setup. Ammonia builds up fast in small volumes.

How many goldfish and what type (common/comet or fancy)?

**Notes:**
- Non-judgmental tone (encourages person upgrading)
- Budget-friendly immediate solution
- Realistic long-term expectations
- Expected engagement: 15-25 upvotes
