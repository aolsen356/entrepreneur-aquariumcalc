# New Aquarium Tank Setup Checklist

**Your Complete Step-by-Step Guide to Starting a Healthy Aquarium**

---

## Before You Start: Planning Phase

### Step 1: Choose Your Tank Size & Location

- [ ] **Decide on tank size**
  - Beginners: 20-30 gallons (easier to maintain than small tanks)
  - Intermediate: 40-75 gallons
  - Advanced: 100+ gallons
  - Note: Larger = more stable water parameters

- [ ] **Find the right location**
  - Away from direct sunlight (causes algae)
  - Away from heating/AC vents
  - On a sturdy, level surface
  - Near electrical outlet
  - Away from high-traffic areas (reduces stress)
  - Floor can support weight (10 lbs per gallon when filled)

- [ ] **Measure space accurately**
  - Length, width, and height available
  - Account for equipment hanging off back
  - Leave space for maintenance access

### Step 2: Decide Your Aquarium Type

- [ ] **Community Tank** (Easiest)
  - Mixed peaceful species
  - Plants optional
  - Standard tropical temps (75-78°F)

- [ ] **Planted Tank**
  - Live plants as primary feature
  - Requires better lighting
  - Substrate and fertilizers needed
  - More maintenance but better water quality

- [ ] **Cichlid Tank**
  - African or South American cichlids
  - Specific water parameters
  - Territorial - plan carefully

- [ ] **Saltwater Tank** (Advanced)
  - Significantly more expensive
  - Different equipment needed
  - Not covered in this beginner guide

## Essential Equipment Shopping List

### Tank & Stand

- [ ] **Aquarium tank** (glass or acrylic)
  - Verify includes lid/glass canopy
  - Check for scratches or cracks
  - If used: test for leaks first

- [ ] **Aquarium stand**
  - Must support 10-12 lbs per gallon
  - Level and sturdy
  - Water-resistant material
  - Storage space underneath (bonus)

### Filtration (Critical for Success)

- [ ] **Filter** (choose one type or combine)
  - **Hang-on-back (HOB)**: Easy, good for most tanks
    - Example: AquaClear, Fluval C Series
    - Flow rate: 4-5x tank volume per hour
  - **Canister filter**: Best filtration, quiet
    - Example: Fluval 07 Series, Eheim Classic
    - Good for 40+ gallon tanks
  - **Sponge filter**: Gentle, good for fry/shrimp
    - Requires air pump
    - Best as supplemental filter

- [ ] **Filter media** (if not included)
  - Mechanical: Filter floss, sponge
  - Biological: Ceramic rings, bio-balls
  - Chemical: Activated carbon (optional)

### Heating & Temperature Control

- [ ] **Aquarium heater**
  - Wattage: 3-5 watts per gallon
  - 20-gallon tank = 75-100W heater
  - 50-gallon tank = 150-200W heater
  - Adjustable thermostat preferred
  - Consider two smaller heaters for large tanks (backup)

- [ ] **Thermometer**
  - Digital preferred (more accurate)
  - Stick-on strips work but less precise
  - Place opposite the heater

### Lighting

- [ ] **Aquarium light**
  - **Low-tech/fish-only**: Basic LED (6-8 hours/day)
  - **Planted tank**: Full-spectrum LED (8-10 hours/day)
  - Timer recommended for consistency
  - Avoid leaving on 24/7 (causes algae)

### Substrate

- [ ] **Gravel or sand** (choose based on fish/plants)
  - **Gravel (standard)**: 1.5-2 lbs per gallon
    - Good for most community fish
    - Easy to clean
  - **Sand**: 1-1.5 lbs per gallon
    - Better for bottom feeders (corydoras, loaches)
    - Harder to clean but looks natural
  - **Planted tank substrate**:
    - Nutrient-rich aqua soil (Fluval Stratum, ADA)
    - 1-2 inch layer, can cap with gravel

- [ ] **Rinse substrate thoroughly** before adding to tank
  - Fill bucket 1/3 with substrate
  - Rinse under tap water until water runs clear
  - Repeat for all substrate

### Water Conditioning & Testing

- [ ] **Water conditioner** (removes chlorine/chloramine)
  - Seachem Prime (best value, detoxifies ammonia)
  - API Stress Coat (adds slime coat protection)
  - Dose for full tank volume at setup

- [ ] **Beneficial bacteria starter**
  - Seachem Stability
  - API Quick Start
  - Fritz Turbo Start 700 (best for fishless cycling)
  - Speeds up nitrogen cycle

- [ ] **Water test kit** (CRITICAL)
  - **API Master Test Kit** (best value, most accurate)
    - Tests: Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, pH
    - Liquid drops (NOT test strips)
  - Alternative: Individual liquid test kits
  - Test strips (less accurate but convenient)

### Maintenance Equipment

- [ ] **Gravel vacuum/siphon**
  - Python No-Spill system (best for large tanks)
  - Basic siphon with bucket (budget option)
  - Size appropriate for tank (small gravel vac for small tanks)

- [ ] **Algae scraper/magnet cleaner**
  - Mag-Float (best for regular use)
  - Razor blade scraper (stubborn algae)
  - Sponge or scrub pad (never use soap)

- [ ] **Fish net**
  - Two nets (easier to catch fish)
  - Fine mesh for small fish
  - Larger net for bigger fish

- [ ] **Buckets** (dedicated to aquarium only)
  - 5-gallon buckets (2-3 minimum)
  - NEVER use soap or chemicals in these buckets
  - Label as "Aquarium Only"

### Optional but Recommended

- [ ] **Air pump and air stone**
  - Increases oxygenation
  - Good for heavily stocked tanks
  - Required for sponge filters

- [ ] **Background** (black or blue)
  - Reduces fish stress
  - Makes colors pop
  - Hides cords and equipment

- [ ] **Decorations** (caves, driftwood, rocks)
  - Provide hiding spots (reduces stress)
  - Natural look: driftwood and rocks
  - Ensure aquarium-safe (no sharp edges)

- [ ] **Timer for lights**
  - Maintains consistent photoperiod
  - Prevents algae from inconsistent lighting
  - Digital or mechanical

---

## Tank Setup Process (Day 1)

### Physical Setup

**Step 1: Clean Everything**
- [ ] Rinse tank with water only (NO SOAP EVER)
- [ ] Rinse all decorations, rocks, driftwood
- [ ] Rinse substrate until water runs clear
- [ ] Wipe down stand

**Step 2: Position Tank**
- [ ] Place stand in final location (you won't move it once filled)
- [ ] Use level to ensure stand is perfectly level
- [ ] Place tank on stand
- [ ] Add background if using (tape to outside back)

**Step 3: Add Substrate**
- [ ] Pour rinsed substrate into tank
- [ ] Slope higher in back (2-3 inches back, 1-2 inches front)
  - Creates depth perception
  - Debris settles in front for easier cleaning
- [ ] Smooth out with clean hands

**Step 4: Add Decorations**
- [ ] Place large rocks and driftwood
  - Create hiding spots and territories
  - Ensure stable (won't fall and crack glass)
- [ ] Arrange caves and ornaments
- [ ] Leave open swimming space in center/front

**Step 5: Install Equipment (Before Adding Water)**
- [ ] Place heater (attach to side or back)
  - At angle for better circulation
  - Fully submerged when water is added
  - Do NOT plug in yet
- [ ] Hang or position filter
  - Check flow direction
  - Do NOT plug in yet
- [ ] Clip thermometer to opposite side from heater

**Step 6: Fill Tank with Water**
- [ ] Place plate or bowl on substrate
- [ ] Pour water slowly onto plate (prevents substrate disturbance)
- [ ] Fill to 1-2 inches from top
- [ ] Water will be cloudy (normal, will clear in 24 hours)

**Step 7: Add Water Conditioner**
- [ ] Dose for full tank volume
  - Seachem Prime: 1ml per 10 gallons
  - Follow bottle instructions
- [ ] Pour conditioner near filter output for circulation

**Step 8: Install Filter Media & Start Equipment**
- [ ] Install filter media in correct order
  - Bottom to top: Mechanical → Biological → Chemical
- [ ] Prime filter (fill with water before plugging in)
- [ ] Plug in filter - verify water flows properly
- [ ] Wait 15 minutes, then plug in heater
  - Heater needs to acclimate to water temp first
  - Set to desired temp (76-78°F for most tropical)
- [ ] Install and turn on light

**Step 9: Add Beneficial Bacteria**
- [ ] Dose according to bottle instructions
- [ ] Pour near filter intake for distribution
- [ ] This begins the nitrogen cycle

---

## The Nitrogen Cycle (Most Important Part)

### What is the Nitrogen Cycle?

Fish waste → **Ammonia** (toxic) → **Nitrite** (toxic) → **Nitrate** (less toxic)

Beneficial bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite, then nitrite to nitrate. Your filter builds up these bacteria over 4-6 weeks. **You MUST cycle your tank before adding fish or they will die.**

### Fishless Cycling (Recommended Method)

**Week 1:**
- [ ] **Day 1**: Add ammonia source
  - Dr. Tim's Ammonium Chloride, or
  - Pure ammonia (no additives), or
  - Fish food (messier method)
  - Target: 2-4 ppm ammonia

- [ ] **Day 3**: Test water
  - Ammonia should still be 2-4 ppm
  - Nitrite: 0 ppm (normal at this stage)
  - Nitrate: 0 ppm

- [ ] **Day 5**: Test water
  - Ammonia may start dropping
  - Nitrite may appear (0.5-2 ppm)
  - Add beneficial bacteria booster

**Week 2-3:**
- [ ] **Every 2-3 days**: Test and re-dose ammonia
  - Keep ammonia at 2-4 ppm
  - Nitrite will spike (can go very high)
  - Nitrate will start appearing
  - Do NOT do water changes (you need the bacteria)

**Week 4-6:**
- [ ] **Daily testing**:
  - Ammonia: Should process to 0 in 24 hours
  - Nitrite: Should drop from high levels to 0
  - Nitrate: Will accumulate (10-40 ppm)

**Cycle is Complete When:**
- [ ] Ammonia: 0 ppm (24 hours after dosing)
- [ ] Nitrite: 0 ppm
- [ ] Nitrate: Present (10-40 ppm)
- [ ] This happens consistently for 3 days in a row

**Before Adding Fish:**
- [ ] Do 50% water change (removes nitrates)
- [ ] Test again: Ammonia 0, Nitrite 0, Nitrate <20 ppm
- [ ] Add fish within 48 hours (bacteria need ammonia to survive)

### Fish-In Cycling (Not Recommended but Sometimes Necessary)

If you MUST cycle with fish:
- [ ] Add only 2-3 HARDY fish (zebra danios, white cloud minnows)
- [ ] Feed very sparingly (every other day)
- [ ] Test daily
- [ ] Do 25% water change EVERY DAY
- [ ] Dose Seachem Prime daily (detoxifies ammonia/nitrite for 24 hours)
- [ ] Watch for gasping, lethargy (signs of poisoning)
- [ ] Cycle takes 4-8 weeks

**Fish-in cycling is stressful and often kills fish. Fishless cycling is always better.**

## Choosing Your First Fish

### Stocking Guidelines

**Rule of Thumb:**
- [ ] 1 inch of adult fish per 1 gallon of water
  - Example: 20-gallon tank = 20 inches of fish
  - A 2-inch fish counts as 2 inches
- [ ] Account for ADULT size, not current size
- [ ] Schooling fish need groups of 6+ (they're stressed alone)

### Best Beginner Fish (Hardy & Peaceful)

## Adding Fish to Your Cycled Tank

### Acclimation Process (Critical for Fish Health)

- [ ] **Turn off aquarium lights** (reduces stress)
- [ ] **Float sealed bag** in tank for 15-20 minutes
  - Equalizes temperature
  - Check bag for leaks

- [ ] **Drip acclimation** (best method):
  - Open bag, pour into clean bucket
  - Use airline tubing to drip tank water into bucket
  - 2-4 drips per second
  - Double the water volume over 30-60 minutes
  - Net fish (don't add store water to tank)
  - Release fish gently into tank

- [ ] **Alternative: Add tank water gradually**
  - Add 1/4 cup tank water to bag every 5 minutes
  - Repeat 6-8 times over 30-40 minutes
  - Net fish, don't add bag water

- [ ] **Turn on lights after 2-4 hours**
- [ ] **Don't feed for 24 hours** (let them settle in)

### Adding Fish Gradually

- [ ] **Week 1**: Add 25% of planned stock
- [ ] **Week 3**: Add another 25% (if ammonia/nitrite still 0)
- [ ] **Week 5**: Add another 25%
- [ ] **Week 7**: Add final 25%

**Do NOT add all fish at once. Your beneficial bacteria need time to grow to handle the increased bioload.**

---

## Weekly Maintenance Schedule

### Daily (Quick Check - 2 minutes)
- [ ] Check temperature (should be stable 76-78°F)
- [ ] Count fish (ensure all are present)
- [ ] Observe behavior (lethargy, gasping, clamped fins = problem)
- [ ] Check filter is running
- [ ] Feed fish (small amount, 1-2x per day)

### Weekly (Water Change & Cleaning - 30-60 minutes)

**Every 7 days:**
- [ ] **Test water parameters**
  - Ammonia: 0 ppm
  - Nitrite: 0 ppm
  - Nitrate: <20 ppm (if higher, do larger water change)
  - pH: Stable (sudden changes are dangerous)

- [ ] **25-30% water change**
  - Turn off heater 15 minutes before (prevent burning out)
  - Use gravel vacuum to siphon out water
  - Vacuum substrate (focus on high-waste areas)
  - Refill with temperature-matched water
  - Add water conditioner for volume of NEW water only
  - Turn heater back on

- [ ] **Wipe down glass**
  - Remove algae with magnet cleaner or scraper
  - Inside glass only

- [ ] **Check equipment**
  - Filter running properly?
  - Heater maintaining temp?
  - Lights functioning?

### Monthly (Deep Maintenance - 1-2 hours)

- [ ] **Rinse filter media** (in old tank water, NEVER tap water)
  - Mechanical media: Rinse until clean
  - Biological media: Gentle rinse only (don't kill bacteria)
  - Replace chemical media (carbon) if using
  - Replace mechanical media if falling apart

- [ ] **Trim plants** (if planted tank)
  - Remove dead leaves
  - Thin out fast-growing plants
  - Replant stem cuttings

- [ ] **Clean decorations**
  - Scrub in old tank water
  - Remove stubborn algae
  - Boil if needed (kills algae)

- [ ] **Test water hardness & pH**
  - Ensure stable parameters
  - Adjust if needed for specific fish

### Every 3-6 Months

- [ ] **Replace filter cartridges** (if using disposable)
- [ ] **Deep clean canister filter**
- [ ] **Replace light bulbs** (if fluorescent)
- [ ] **Inspect heater** (replace if not maintaining temp)

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Cloudy Water

**White/Gray Cloudiness:**
- **Cause**: Bacterial bloom (common in new tanks)
- [ ] Wait 3-7 days (will clear on its own)
- [ ] Don't do water changes (you need the bacteria)
- [ ] Reduce feeding

**Green Cloudiness:**
- **Cause**: Algae bloom (too much light or nutrients)
- [ ] Reduce lighting to 6 hours/day
- [ ] Do 25% water change
- [ ] Reduce feeding
- [ ] Don't place tank in direct sunlight

**Brown Cloudiness:**
- **Cause**: Substrate not rinsed enough
- [ ] Do water changes until clear
- [ ] Increase filter flow

### Algae Growth

**Green Algae (most common):**
- [ ] Reduce light to 6-8 hours/day
- [ ] Reduce feeding
- [ ] Add algae eaters (nerite snails, otocinclus)
- [ ] Do weekly water changes
- [ ] Don't overfeed

**Brown Algae (Diatoms):**
- [ ] Common in new tanks (will go away after a few months)
- [ ] Wipe glass weekly
- [ ] Add nerite snails

**Black Beard Algae (stubborn):**
- [ ] Reduce excess nutrients
- [ ] Spot treat with hydrogen peroxide (1ml per gallon)
- [ ] Remove heavily affected decorations
- [ ] Increase water flow

### Fish Dying

**During Cycling:**
- [ ] Ammonia or nitrite poisoning (test immediately)
- [ ] Do 50% water change
- [ ] Dose Seachem Prime daily
- [ ] Reduce feeding to every other day
- [ ] Consider fishless cycling next time

**In Established Tank:**
- [ ] Test water immediately (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH)
- [ ] Check temperature (heater malfunction?)
- [ ] Look for signs of disease (white spots, clamped fins, rapid breathing)
- [ ] Check if fish are compatible (aggression?)
- [ ] Quarantine sick fish if disease suspected

### Fish Gasping at Surface

**Causes:**
- [ ] Low oxygen (turn up filter, add air stone)
- [ ] High temperature (cool down tank)
- [ ] Ammonia/nitrite poisoning (test water, do water change)
- [ ] Overstocking (reduce fish, increase filtration)

### Filter Not Working

- [ ] Check if unplugged or power outage
- [ ] Check impeller for debris
- [ ] Verify intake not clogged
- [ ] Prime filter (fill with water before starting)
- [ ] Replace if motor burned out
